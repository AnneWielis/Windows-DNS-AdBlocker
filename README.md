# Windows-DNS-AdBlocker

A simple to use PowerShell script that uses an adblocking list and imports it into the Windows Server DNS entry list to block them. TO be used as a scheduled task to run and update entries. 

# Tested

The script has been tested in our own environment on a Windows Server 2008 R2 DNS machine but the script is flexible enough to work for the newer Operating Systems as well. 

# Work in Progress

Before the script will be posted I will first need to strip it of some company specific code. Also I am still learning PowerShell so it may not be as pretty as it can be but I hope I improve myself and the script as it goes.
